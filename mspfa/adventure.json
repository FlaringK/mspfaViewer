The Squiddles\n\nUsed to.\n\nI was watching what I presumed to be another rerun, late at the Witching Hour. But something was weird - there was no music. The Squiddles seemed unhappy. That was odd to me. What could upset these creatures of pure, unadulterated love and joy? Why did it feel as though they were looking directly at me with their eyes, black as the taint of a syphilitic whore?\n\nSlowly, a title card faded onto the screen. \"THE SQUIDDLES GO TO HELL\"\n\nThe episode started out normal enough, with Mariana Max and Co. up to their usual. But then, all of a sudden, things took a turn that made my toes curl in outrage. The Squiddles stumbled upon a crevice at the bottom of the ocean and, without hesitation, decided to jump right in. Woe! If only they knew they were never to return. Where was Seagull Sammy's sage wisdom now?\n\nAs they descended into the swirling abyss, the animation was replaced with an unnerving, low budget stop motion style. But the worst part was when they finally reached the bottom of the hole and met Satan himself (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried.) Satan was this huge, muscular demon with horns and a pitchfork, and he was PISSED. He started yelling at the Squiddles and telling them that they weren't supposed to be there, that they had messed with forces beyond their understanding\n\nThe Squiddles tried to apologize and beg for mercy, but it was too late. Satan grabbed them and threw them into a pit of fire, where they were doomed to suffer for all eternity, poked with hot sticks by demons\n\nThe episode ended with a creepy, distorted version of the Squiddles theme song playing over images of the Squiddles screaming and being tortured in hell\n\nI still don't know where this lost episode came from, or who allowed it to be made, but one thing is for sure: I am NEVER going to be the same. The Squiddles may have been cute, but they definitely didn't belong in Hell\n[/color]\n\n[/spoiler]",
